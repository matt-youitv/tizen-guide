== Install AsciiDoctor

link:https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor[The official guide for installing AsciiDoctor] is pretty straight forward.


== Building the Docs

=== HTML

HTML backend is supported out of the box! Just run this command:

`asciidoctor <adoc-file>`

=== PDF

To build PDFs you will need to link:https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor-pdf[install this extension.]

Once that is installed simply run this command:

`asciidoctor-pdf <adoc-file>`


== GitHub

GitHub seems to do a pretty good job of rendering AsciiDoctor files.

The only incompatibility I have come across so far is that GitHub does not support the `include::<adoc-file>[]` directive. __This seems to be for security reasons.__


== Text Editor Plugins

=== Atom Plugin

The official plugin pack for the Atom text editor is available link:https://atom.io/packages/asciidoc-assistant[here].

=== VS Code Plugin

A official__*__ plugin for VS Code is available link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode[here].

__* The repo does seem to hosted on the link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoctor GitHub Account].__

=== Other Plugins

A list of other plugins is available link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/[here].
