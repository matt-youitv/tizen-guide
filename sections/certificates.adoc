One of the biggest pains is how certificates are handled with Tizen TVs. Here are some key points:

- TVs need to be assigned to a certificate **when the certificate is created!** They cannot be added to an existing certificate (I know)
- Any TVs that are connected when creating a certificate will have their DUIDs automatically populated, but you should always double check that they have been added at that step in creating a certificate
- The certificate needs to be a Samsung Certificate (the Tizen ones stopped working many moons ago and none of the elders know why)
- The build arguments and environment variables for specifying a specific signing certificate are broken!
  - The only way to select the certificate that will be ised to sign is by using `certificate-manager` and select the certificate you want to be the default and then click the checkmark on the upper right side of the window

== Shared Certificates

Using our shared certificates is good practice because it means that developers will not have to remember to install their certificate on a TV every time they want to use a TV.

TODO: Link to where the certificates are stored and instructions on adding them to `certificate-manager`.


== Generating a New Certificate

IMPORTANT: You should not do this if the TV already has a Shared Certificate created for it!

WARNING: You must use a Samsung Certificate for newer TVs.

WARNING: You need to select "partner" in two (I think two?) places when creating the certificate or it may not work.


== Installing the Certificate on a TV

If you are using the pre-made certificates then this step is not necessary. However if you have created a new certificate for a new TV this information may come in handy.
